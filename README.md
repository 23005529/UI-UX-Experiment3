# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of two leading food delivery applications—Zomato and Swiggy—using Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and recommend improvements that enhance overall usability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

## Algorithm:

### Step 1: Selection of Apps
Choose the competing applications for evaluation:

Zomato

Swiggy

### Step 2: Define Framework
Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria.

### Step 3: Data Collection
Perform hands-on testing of each app.
Execute common tasks such as:

Searching for restaurants and dishes

Placing and customizing orders

Tracking live deliveries

Applying coupons and offers

Exploring subscription services (Zomato Gold, Swiggy One)

Contacting support
Record observations for each heuristic.

### Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation
Evaluate each app against the 10 heuristics.
Note usability strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations.

### Step 5: Comparative Analysis
Create a comparison table to analyze how each app performs.
Highlight the best performer per heuristic.

### Step 6: Problem Identification
List recurring usability issues.
Prioritize critical problems affecting user experience.

### Step 7: Recommendations
Suggest actionable design or feature improvements for each app.
Align recommendations with UX best practices.

### Step 8: Conclusion
Summarize the overall evaluation.
Identify which app delivers the strongest UX and provide improvement paths for the other.

## Output:

## Heuristic Evaluation of Food Delivery Apps: Zomato and Swiggy

### Introduction
This report presents a heuristic evaluation of two leading food delivery platforms: Zomato and Swiggy. The evaluation is based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on user experience (UX), interface design, and feature efficiency. The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and suggest improvements to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Evaluation Framework

We used Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the framework:

Visibility of system status

Match between system and real world

User control and freedom

Consistency and standards

Error prevention

Recognition rather than recall

Flexibility and efficiency of use

Aesthetic and minimalist design

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Help and documentation

## Heuristic Evaluation Results
Heuristic	Zomato	Swiggy	Insights
1. Visibility of System Status	Clear live tracking, order updates with map	Real-time tracking, rider details	Both strong, Swiggy slightly faster in updates
2. Match with Real World	Familiar naming (“Dine Out”, “Gold”)	Straightforward food-first terms	Zomato better for dining + delivery, Swiggy clearer for quick orders
3. User Control & Freedom	Easy cancellation & reorder	Limited cancellation flexibility	Zomato gives more user freedom
4. Consistency & Standards	Consistent UI but slightly cluttered with offers	Clean and consistent across screens	Swiggy more consistent and less distracting
5. Error Prevention	Alerts before cancel, promo misapplies sometimes	Prevents wrong address/orders better	Swiggy stronger in preventing order errors
6. Recognition vs Recall	Personalized food suggestions, saved favorites	Focus on repeat orders, recent history	Both strong; Zomato more discovery-friendly
7. Flexibility & Efficiency	Advanced filters, multiple cuisine tags	Quick reordering, faster checkout	Zomato best for browsing, Swiggy best for speed
8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design	Visual-heavy, slightly crowded	Minimal, simple, orange/white clean look	Swiggy wins aesthetics
9. Error Recovery	Good refund handling, delayed support sometimes	Faster refunds, easier escalation	Swiggy better in error recovery
10. Help & Documentation	In-app chat + FAQs, response delay	In-app support, faster live help	Swiggy stronger in support speed
    
## Key Findings

Zomato: Strength in discovery, personalization, and dine-out integrations. Weakness in cluttered UI and slower support response.

Swiggy: Strength in clean design, quick reordering, and reliable support. Weakness in limited browsing flexibility and weaker dine-out integration.

Recommendations

For Zomato:

Simplify home screen to reduce clutter from promotions.

Speed up customer support responses.

Improve error prevention during checkout (e.g., promo code failures).

For Swiggy:

Enhance food discovery features with richer filters and curated collections.

Add more dining-out and experience-based features like Zomato Gold.

Provide better flexibility in cancellations and order editing.
